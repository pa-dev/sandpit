<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	The Greater Lincolnshire Employer Survey was commissioned on behalf of the Greater Lincolnshire [1]
	LEP to give a snapshot of business trends. The findings will support future economic planning and decision making. 1,515 employers across Greater Lincolnshire were surveyed by telephone in April and May 2014. The survey gives a statistically robust picture of business performance and opinion on a range of topics. These topics include markets and trading, growth and innovation, finance and investment, recruitment, employment and skills, and the environment. Businesses were also asked for their perception of Greater Lincolnshire as a place to do business.
</p>
<p>
	The survey was conducted at a time of relative economic optimism as demonstrated by the high proportion (65%) of businesses reporting improved performance during the previous year and an equally high proportion (72%) anticipating growth over the coming twelve months. It supports findings from the Quarterly Economic Survey of businesses in Lincolnshire which has been reporting improving business conditions and growing optimism since the beginning of 2013.

<h2>Doing business in Greater Lincolnshire</h2>
<h3>Headlines</h3>

<p>
	The survey found that the majority of businesses (93%) have always been located in Greater Lincolnshire. The area has a very stable and established business community with two thirds trading in the area for more than ten years.
</p>
<p>
	Businesses rate the area highest in terms of access to customers and aspects of living in the area, including the range of housing and strong communities. Approximately 70% of priority sector [2]  employers (Agri-Food, Manufacturing/ Engineering and Visitor Economy) give Greater Lincolnshire a positive or very positive rating as a place their business can grow.
</p>
<p>
	Greater Lincolnshire is rated lowest for its transport infrastructure, its image as seen by external suppliers and customers, and its ability to attract people to move to the area to work. This is particularly so for employers based in East Lindsey and Boston, and private A high proportion (45%) of Manufacturing/Engineering priority sector employers also rate access to skilled staff as poor.
</p>
<p>
	Businesses said low cost premises, access to funding, and access to local training were important to growth. However, poor transport infrastructure is cited by 30% of private sector employers as an obstacle
</p>
<p>
	One in eight employers (13%) is considering relocating their business in the next 2 years, with just 2% considering locating outside of the area.

<h2>Business Growth</h2>
<h3>Headlines</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		65% of employers reported an increase in financial measure, including profitability, turnover, sales and market share in the last 12 months.
	</li>
	<li>
		72% of businesses expect performance to improve over the next 12 months.
	</li>
	<li>
		More than half of employers said having suitable, low cost premises, access to funding, the availability of highly skilled labour, and  access to local training were important to growth.
	</li>

</ul>

<p>
	The Employer Survey paints a buoyant picture in terms of local business performance and optimism, supporting findings from other recent local and national surveys[3] including the Lincolnshire Quarterly Economic Survey.
</p>

<p>
	More than a fifth of employers in Greater Lincolnshire (22%) reported an increase in the number of staff employed at their site during the last 12 This proportion increases with business size to 46% of 100+ employers.
</p>

<p>
	65% of employers reported improved performance in the last 12 months in any of the financial measures i.e. profitability, turnover, sales and market share, whilst 72% expect improvements next year. Over half of all businesses surveyed said profits and turnover had increased last year, 40% reported growth in domestic sales, but a lower proportion (32%) reported an improvement in market share.
</p>
<p>
	This also appears to be the case locally with a higher proportion (69%) of Manufacturing /Engineering sector employers reporting improvements in any financial measure last year and 75% expecting improvements next year.
</p>
<p>
	However, of the 113 private sector Health and Care businesses interviewed for the survey only 43% reported improvements in any financial measure over the past 12 months (compared with 65% in total). Only 47%, (compared to 72% of all businesses) said they expected improvements next year. The Health and Care sector has been highlighted as an important emerging sector for the local economy due to the potential for growth arising from an increasingly ageing population. This potential however, does not appear to be having an impact on either sector optimism or growth; a factor which may be worth further investigation.
</p>
<h2>Innovation</h2>
<h3>Headlines</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		38% of all businesses introduced new or significantly improved products or services in the last 12 months rising to 47% of the Manufacturing/Engineering sector.
	</li>
	<li>
		The majority (59%) of employers that have introduced new or improved products have collaborated with others (mainly other businesses) in developing their ideas.
	</li>

</ul>

<p>
	Compared to findings from a national survey in 2012 [5], Greater Lincolnshire employers are less likely to have introduced new or improved products or services (38%, compared with 43%), but these new products or services are more likely to be completely new (22%, compared with 17% in SBS 2012).

Employers that export and have a website are significantly more likely than those that do not export or do not have a website to strongly agree that access to broadband (superfast broadband in particular) is important. Two-thirds (67%) of all respondents agree that access to broadband for home-working is important for their business.
</p>

<h3>Recruitment</h3>
<p>
	48% of employers in Greater Lincolnshire have recruited This increases to 83% of those with 10 or more staff. The most likely posts recruited for are those at the lower skill levels, semi- and un-skilled workers. Of those employers who recruited, half recruited to new posts. Priority sector businesses are more likely to recruit to new posts than average.
</p>

<p>
	The UK Commission Employer Skills Survey 2013 warned economic growth may be constrained by skills shortages with particular sectors being harder hit than others. Locally 19% of employers cited this issue as a barrier to growth, rising to 30% of Manufacturing/Engineering priority sector employers.
</p>

<p>
	Around one in four employers that have recruited (23%) report some of the This equates to 11% of all employers. The UK Commission Employment and Skills Survey 2013 reports the number of skills shortage vacancies has doubled since 2009. It also found that professional skills are currently the most difficult to recruit and this is borne out by local findings. Of those businesses in Greater Lincolnshire that tried to recruit 28% found professional vacancies hard to fill. 23% found managerial posts hard to fill and 19% found skilled manual and technical crafts posts hard to fill.
</p>
<h3>Skills and Training</h3>

	Across Greater Lincolnshire, employers estimate that 6% of their workforce has no qualifications. This rises to 10% in the Agri-Food sector and 8% in the Manufacturing/ Engineering sector. 18% have level 4 equivalent qualifications or above but employers in the Agri-Food sector estimate only 9% of staff have this level of qualification.
</p>

<p>

This compares to 15% nationally [6].
</p>

<p>
	The proportion of Greater Lincolnshire employers funding or arranging training for their staff in the last 12 months is on a par with national surveys (64% compared with 66% [7]
	). Training is mainly delivered by private training providers, with around one in four employers that have delivered training using public sector educational FE/HE institutions in the area. Training delivery can be limited by the capacity of the business to release employees for training and by cost. In addition almost half have difficulty finding suitable training.

<h3>Headlines</h3>

	</li>
	<li>
		The manufacturing sector however, buys most of their supplies from elsewhere in the UK.
	</li>

Employers within public administration/ education/health and agriculture/fishing sectors are more likely to source locally, whilst manufacturers obtain the majority of their supplies from elsewhere in the UK. Where employers do not use local suppliers, it is mainly because the products or services are not available (to their knowledge) in the area. This supports findings of earlier<a href="http://www.research-lincs.org.uk/UI/Documents/Supply%20Chains%20FINAL%20report%20full.pdf">research</a>
